######### PROBLEM LOG #########

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 3/4/2024
Problem: still need to make ft_ra & ft_rra. Functions missing.
Solved: yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 3/4/2024
Problem: unsure? too many pushes from a to b, not printing any operations in between.
Solved: not fully, but found out that ft_initialize_list had a mistake. still loop issue after pushing everything from a to b.
Changed: pass the size of temp_stack to ft_initialize_list and use a for loop to iterate over the array
while (temp_stack[i])
to:
while (i < size)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 3/4/2024
Problem: with example array, array is rb when not supposed to.
Solved: yes
Changed: found error in rotate_to_last_first, swapped conditions.
NOTE: check ft_rrotate_to_first and last: are those conditions correct or also swapped?? <---------------!!!!!!!!!!!

DATE: 3/4/2024
Problem: infinite loop after pushing everything from stack_a to stack_b
Solved: no.
Changed:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 4/4/2024
Problem: Suddenly another infinite loop in first part of the code.
Solved: yes
Changed:
function to track size of stacks was incorrect: was always one too big.
function to find closest numbers in top and bottom were incorrect: moved the part of moving to the next element to end of the loop (skipped first element before).
function ft_equal had error to calculate distance to bottom: we added + 1 to equal that distance to the top starts at 1.
again mistake in how often to rotate: updated (for good?), not sure this is the last time i have to change this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 4/4/2024
Problem: void ft_search_lowest(t_list **stack, t_track *track)
Solved: yes
Changed:
tried to access out of bound memory, change if condition from:
if (temp->next->value > temp->value)
to:
if (temp->value < track->lowest_value)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATE: 4/4/2024
Problem: it doesnt sort properly 
Solved:  1/2
Changed:
ft_check_3 wasnt sorting properly. changed it completely and also updated ft_search_lowest, because the index of the to be checked stack might not be up to date when it starts, now it is.

Atoi doesnt currently handle that error!
